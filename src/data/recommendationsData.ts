The project was a very high visibility project navigating into spaces such as Predictive Intelligence and other areas of digital transformation, and the application the team built was the web interface for this. Jinal's contributions were on both the back and front ends of the application, as well as architectural decisions and guidance for low-level coding. Jinal is very versed in back end technologies and does great with delving into new libraries and frameworks on the front end, even during times of high pressure and intensity on the project. I was extremely pleased with how well the project launched, and was certainly in part due to Jinal's contributions. I would absolutely love working with Jinal again, given the chance.I wish you the best Jinal!",
